Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch in a joint statement on Sunday said the investments were made in 2015, well before her appointment as a whole-time member of SEBI in 2017 and the subsequent elevation as chairperson in March 2022, and in capacity as \"private citizens living in Singapore\". These funds became \"dormant\" on her appointment in SEBI.  \"SEBI was tasked with investigating investment funds relating to the Adani matter, which would include funds Ms Buch was personally invested in and funds by the same sponsor which were specifically highlighted in our original report.

Adani group is one of the India's largest multinational company with a diversified business portfolio. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images   Shares of Adani Group fell on Monday, after a new report from U.S. short seller Hindenburg accused the chair of India's capital markets regulator of having conflicts of interest that prevented an in-depth probe of fraud allegations. The Indian group's flagship firm Adani Enterprises slipped as much as 5% in early morning deals, before paring some of its losses. Shares of Adani Total Gas, Adani Power, Adani Wilmar and Adani Energy Solutions all fell sharply on the news in morning trade. Total losses for Adani Group companies came to $9 billion because of the early plunge, Reuters reported. Hindenburg published a report on Saturday which alleged that both Madhabi Puri Buch, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and her husband, Dhaval Buch, previously held investments in offshore funds also used by the Adani Group. Hindenburg said it does not think SEBI \"can be trusted as an objective arbiter in the Adani matter.\" Madhabi Puri Buch and Dhaval Buch both denied wrongdoing and said the report's claims were baseless. Adani on Sunday rejected the latest allegations from Hindenburg, describing the report as a \"red herring.\" The company said that its overseas holding structure was fully transparent. Led by billionaire Gautam Adani, the multinational conglomerate operates across a wide range of sectors, including commodities trading, airports, utilities and renewable energy. Hindenburg's report comes roughly 18 months after it first accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation and corporate fraud. The findings, published in January 2023, led to a stock rout in excess of $100 billion. Adani has denied all the allegations and shares have partially recovered.",

        "news_content": "India is poised to narrow the gap with China in MSCI Inc.\u2019s gauge for developing nations. Image: Bloomberg   4 min read Last Updated : Aug 12 2024 | 9:35 AM IST   \n By Abhishek Vishnoi and Chiranjivi Chakraborty \nIndia is poised to narrow the gap with China in MSCI Inc.\u2019s gauge for developing nations.\n \nAnalysts from firms including Smartkarma and IIFL Securities Ltd. expect India\u2019s weight in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index to rise by at least one percentage point following the index provider\u2019s review this week. This would bring the country almost on par with China, which currently accounts for 22.33 per cent of the benchmark. India lags at 19.99 per cent.\nA higher weighting for India will position it to become the new anchor for emerging market equities, likely driving increased flows into the country. Fund managers say that India\u2019s rising heft may make the EM gauge more appealing to global investors who have been wary due to China\u2019s sway over the index.  \n \n\u201cIt can make the EM index more balanced, where secular growth stories like India receive higher allocation\u201d compared with more cyclical markets like China and Korea, said Vivek Dhawan, portfolio manager at Candriam Belgian NV.\n  \n      \nThis shift has a side effect: index followers may be forced to allocate funds to India\u2019s already-expensive stocks at a time when crowded trades are taking a hit due to the turmoil in global markets. \nIndia \u2014 long touted as the \u201cnext China\u201d \u2014 has emerged as a favorite among investors, driven by its robust economic growth, a growing middle class and burgeoning manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, China is dealing with long-term economic challenges and increasingly strained relations with the West.\n \n\u201cMany global investors who didn\u2019t look at India as a standalone allocation in the past would now look at it more favorably,\u201d said Hiren Dasani, co-head of Emerging Markets Equity and lead portfolio manager of India Equity strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n  \nChina\u2019s standing in emerging markets has shrunk in the past few years, while India\u2019s has steadily expanded. At its peak in 2020, China accounted for 40 per cent of the MSCI EM Index, but that weighting has dropped amid Beijing\u2019s regulatory crackdowns and efforts to deleverage its indebted property sector.\nAs of end of July, India\u2019s weight was just 2.34 percentage points away from China\u2019s in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, a regional benchmark, a recurring pattern across most gauges from major index providers. MSCI didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment outside of regular business hours.\n\u201cWith a rising equity market, increase in free float for companies and new large listings in India, the gap in the weightings should continue to narrow heading into year-end,\u201dsaid Brian Freitas, an analyst at Smartkarma.\nMeanwhile, Taiwan is competing fiercely with India in the race to replace China\u2019s top spot in emerging market equity portfolios. As of the end of July, Taiwan accounted for 18.39 per cent of MSCI\u2019s EM index. \nWhile India has benefited from the infrastructure boom brought about by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s modernization projects, Taiwan\u2019s rise has been supported by global interest in artificial intelligence chipmakers. It\u2019s home to the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\nIn its review, MSCI is likely to add six stocks to its key India index, including Samsung Electronics Co. supplier Dixon Technologies (India) Ltd. and property developer Oberoi Realty Ltd., according to Abhilash Pagaria, head of alternative and quantitative analysis at Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd. HDFC Bank Ltd., India\u2019s largest by market value, may also see a gradual increase in its weighting, he wrote.\nWhile Chinese stocks have struggled, India\u2019s NSE Nifty 50 Index has risen 12 per cent this year, following Modi\u2019s third consecutive term in the office. The benchmark gauge is set for a ninth straight year of annual gains.\nThe contrasting trajectories highlights investors\u2019 preference for India even as China\u2019s equities remain very cheap. It also underscores Beijing\u2019s inability to stem the downtrend in its markets. \n\u201cWe do look at India as a bit of a diversifier against some of China\u2019s weakness,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \u201cA lot of the potential that people have been speaking about for years and years is now looking to be fulfilled.\u201d",

Adani Group, the Indian conglomerate rocked by a Hindenburg Research report last year, has faced another heavy share selloff after the short seller accused the head of India\u2019s market regulator of having links to offshore funds also used by the group.\nAbout $2.43bn, or 1 percent, was wiped off the market value of Adani companies by the end of the trading day on Monday although that was a substantial recovery from earlier losses of more than $13bn.\nThe battle between Hindenburg Research and Adani Group began 18 months ago when the United States-based short seller alleged Adani improperly used tax havens, accusations the group denied again on Sunday, saying its overseas holding structure was fully transparent.\nCiting whistleblower documents, Hindenburg said on Saturday that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson of the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) since 2022, has a conflict of interest in the Adani matter due to previous investments.\nBuch said the report\u2019s allegations were baseless, and in a separate statement, the regulator said allegations made by Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group have been duly investigated.\nShares in the group\u2019s flagship firm, Adani Enterprises, closed out Monday 1.1 percent lower while Adani Ports, Adani Total Gas, Adani Power, Adani Wilmar and Adani Energy Solutions were down between 0.6 percent and 4.2 percent.

This is a temporary, knee-jerk reaction. Things will get back to normalcy,\u201d said Sunny Agrawal, head of fundamental equity research at SBICAPS Securities.\nInvestments from Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company and US boutique investment firm GQG Partners have helped restore some investor confidence since Hindenburg\u2019s first report in January 2023 with Adani Group\u2019s share value losses narrowing to about $32.5bn from $150bn in the immediate aftermath.\nBuch termed Hindenburg\u2019s allegations an attempt at \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d after the regulator\u2019s enforcement action and \u201cshow cause\u201d notice to the short seller for violating Indian rules.

File\n| Photo Credit: ANI\n   Senior BJP leader and former Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday (August 12, 2024) accused the Congress of backing the Hindenburg controversy to stop investments in India and rejected the Congress\u2019 demand for a JPC probe into allegations against the SEBI chairperson. \u201cThe SEBI had sent a notice to the U.S.-based Hindenburg as part of its last year\u2019s allegations of stock market manipulation against the Adani group but it never joined the probe and has instead launched an attack on its chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch, he said. Mr. Prasad noted that the Supreme Court had ordered the investigation.   Also read | Hindenburg allegations: Adani group stocks tumble    On the recent report of Hindenburg Research, Mr. Prasad said, \u201cAfter being rebuffed by the people of India, the Congress party, its allies and the toolkit gang have conspired together to usher in economic anarchy and instability in India.\u201d \u201cThe 10-year-old rule of the Congress between 2004 and 2014 was marked by several alleged scams,\u201d Mr. Prasad noted as he questioned why such critical reports were not brought out then. He alleged, \u201cThe Congress party leadership is involved in creating economic anarchy based on this fictitious report.\u201d He, however, asserted that investors have come to realise the \u201cconspiracy\u201d and rejected the attempts to jolt the market. \u201cHindenburg report is released on Saturday, there is uproar on Sunday so the capital market is destabilized on Monday,\u201d said Mr. Shankar. He further claimed that India is a safe, stable and promising market in the shares as well.     Noting that small investors have put their money in stock market in large numbers, he wondered why the Congress wants to harm them. He claimed, \u201cIn its pathological hatred against Prime Minister Narendra Modi led by Rahul Gandhi and his toolkit friends, the Congress has developed hatred for India.\u201d      \u201cIt is SEBI\u2019s legal responsibility to ensure that the market runs smoothly. When SEBI issued a notice against Hindenburg, after completing its entire inquiry in July, which was done under the supervision of the Supreme Court, then without giving any answer in favour of its defence, they have made this attack, a baseless attack,\u201d he alleged. At the press conference, he also slammed the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal over the rape and murder of a doctor at a State-run hospital, alleging that it was trying to cover up. He said the State government should hand over the probe to the CBI. Amid attacks on minority Hindus in the unrest-hit Bangladesh, the BJP leader questioned the silence of Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, and noted that PM Modi had spoken about the need to protect them.

Chinese markets lagged their peers, having mostly missed last week\u2019s rebound rally amid persistent concerns over an economic slowdown in the country. A string of key June quarter earnings are also due this week. A market holiday in Japan made for softer trading volumes in Asia, although Nikkei 225 Futures still rose. Regional markets took positive cues from a strong Friday close on Wall Street, which saw U.S. stock benchmarks erase all of their losses logged last week. U.S. stock index futures fell slightly in Asian trade. Focus this week is largely on U.S. consumer price index data, due Wednesday, for more cues on when the Federal Reserve will begin trimming interest rates. Investors are split over a 25 and 50 basis point cut in September. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI was the best performer in Asia, up 0.9% on gains in technology stocks. Australia\u2019s ASX 200 rose 0.5%, while most Southeast Asian markets rose slightly. Chinese stocks lag, major earnings on tap China\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes moved in a flat-to-low range on Monday, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index fell 0.2%. Sentiment towards China remained constrained by persistent concerns over a slowing economic recovery in the country, especially following a string of weak readings for July. While recent inflation data did show some improvement, it still remained to be seen whether China\u2019s disinflationary trend was reversing. Focus this week is on earnings from some of China\u2019s biggest internet firms, with Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) (HK:9988) and JD.com (HK:9618) (NASDAQ:JD) set to report their June quarter results this week. Indian markets eye soft open amid Hindenburg-SEBI showdown Futures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a soft open on Monday, as sentiment towards Indian markets was soured by new allegations against India\u2019s securities regulator from short seller Hindenburg Research. The firm alleged that the head of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Madhabi Puri Buch, had invested in offshore funds linked to the Adani Group. This comes after Hindenburg had last year taken a short position against Adani over allegations of fraud and share price manipulation against the Indian conglomerate. SEBI issued an advisory on Sunday, asking investors to remain calm before reacting to any reports from Hindenburg. The Nifty and the BSE Sensex 30 were sitting close to record highs after a stellar rally through most of 2024. But this also made Indian stocks more vulnerable to volatility and profit-taking.  CPI data from India is also due on Monday, and is expected to show some cooling in price pressures.
